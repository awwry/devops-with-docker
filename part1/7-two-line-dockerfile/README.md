I ran `docker build . -t web-server` in this directory to build the image
with tag `web-server`.

Then I started a new container with the container using `docker run web-server`.
The output seemed to be right:

```
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Creating an Engine instance with the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached.

[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
 - using env:   export GIN_MODE=release
 - using code:  gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

[GIN-debug] GET    /*path                    --> server.Start.func1 (3 handlers)
