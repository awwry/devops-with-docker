When a container using the image `devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise` was ran, it
prompted for password. 

I navigated to the [README page of the image in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise)
and found out that I could use the input "basics". 

When I used it, I found the secret message:

```
Give me the password: basics
You found the correct password. Secret message is:
"This is the secret message"
```
